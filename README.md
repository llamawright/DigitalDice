DigitalDice
===========

A dice rolling app for Android.

Written in Python using Kivy.

The bottom row of buttons are programmable and the buttons programmed retain there code when the app is
closed and reopened.

Use # to represent a dice roll as in #6 (a number from 1 thru 6)  and 3#8, three eight sided dice added.
Also @ can be used for multiple rolls, as in 6@3#6  produces 6 numbers each of 3 six sided added together.
